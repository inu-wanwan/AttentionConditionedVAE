Epoch 1 / 10 Train:   0%|                 | 0/14052 [00:00<?, ?it/s]Some weights of RobertaModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at DeepChem/ChemBERTa-77M-MLM and are newly initialized: ['roberta.pooler.dense.bias', 'roberta.pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
